# Minecraft .net edition

## The basics
This is a indie project - clone of Minecraft - Java edition, which has as an aim to fix some preformance issues with Minecraft and best of all - making a modding api for all Minecraft modders out there.
As we all know Java is slow and painful to develop for, so preformance is superior in .Net framework.
The project is absolutely open source, so anyone can contribute, or take it and modify it.

## Sublibraries

This project wouldn't pe possible, whitout making some side libraries, like:

1. Window - Manages the GUI and 3D OpenGL rendering, by offering a easy to use API
2. MinecraftNetCore - Contains core block system and modding API
3. MinecraftWorlds - A easy to use minecraft world reader
## Libraries in use
1. OpenTK - literally it would have took me ages to make this project without a tool like OpenTK
## Modding API
Coming in the near future
